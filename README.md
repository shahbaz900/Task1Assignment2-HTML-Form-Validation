# Summary:

This GitHub repository contains code for Task-1: HTML Form Validation Using JavaScript. The task involved creating two forms, SignIn and SignUp, using HTML and CSS. The SignIn form comprises two fields for username and password, while the SignUp form consists of at least 8 fields of different types to demonstrate front-end validation for various data inputs.

The validation of form input fields is achieved using pure JavaScript, with the option to utilize regular expressions (regex) for validation purposes. Various input field validations have been implemented, including:

- Ensuring that input fields are not empty.
- Requiring passwords to contain special and numeric characters.
- Validating email addresses to be in the correct format.
- Implementing age validation to ensure a valid number or within a specified range.

Additionally, the code allows for setting custom validations according to specific requirements.

The repository provides a comprehensive demonstration of front-end form validation techniques using JavaScript, enhancing user experience and ensuring data integrity.
